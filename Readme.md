# Ekoparty 2021 - Fuzzing&Exploiting challenges

## Requirements
- All you need for this course is a running Linux system with an internet connection. You will find a suitable VMware image in the exercises.
- At least basic Linux skills are highly recommended.
- All the exercises have been tested on Ubuntu **20.04.2 LTS**. You can find an Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS VMware image [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_m1x-SHcm7Muov2mlmbbt8nkrMYp0Q3K/view?usp=sharing). You can also use VirtualBox instead of VMware.
- In this course we're going to use [AFL++](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus), a newer and superior fork of Micha≈Ç "lcamtuf" Zalewski's AFL, for solving the fuzzing exercises.
